# Crytocurrencies
Mod 18 Unsupervised Learning
## Overview of Project

Learn tactics of unsupervised machine lerning by applying key principasl such as PCA, dimension reduction, and visualization to continue to explore this topic

### Purpose
Use a cryptocurrency file to look at different unsupervised machine learning models.  Explore how preprocessing data affects PCA as well as the accuracy of the ML model's results
## Analysis and Challenges
It's harder than it looks to achieve a level of accuracy that one could find satisfying.  Despite information provided in the challenge about expected accuracy levels it was still disappointing to see that several attempts at adjusting different aspects of the model only provided negligble impact on the overall accuracy and loss results.
